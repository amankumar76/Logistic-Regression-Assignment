## üìò Questions

### Question 1  
What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear Regression?  

### Question 2  
Explain the role of the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression.  

### Question 3  
What is Regularization in Logistic Regression and why is it needed?  

### Question 4  
What are some common evaluation metrics for classification models, and why are they important?  

### Question 5  
Write a Python program that loads a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, splits into train/test sets, trains a Logistic Regression model, and prints its accuracy.  

### Question 6  
Write a Python program to train a Logistic Regression model using L2 regularization (Ridge) and print the model coefficients and accuracy.  

### Question 7  
Write a Python program to train a Logistic Regression model for multiclass classification using `multi_class='ovr'` and print the classification report.  

### Question 8  
Write a Python program to apply GridSearchCV to tune **C** and **penalty** hyperparameters for Logistic Regression and print the best parameters and validation accuracy.  

### Question 9  
Write a Python program to standardize the features before training Logistic Regression and compare the model's accuracy with and without scaling.  

### Question 10  
Imagine you are working at an e-commerce company that wants to predict which customers will respond to a marketing campaign. Given an imbalanced dataset (only 5% of customers respond), describe the approach you‚Äôd take to build a Logistic Regression model ‚Äî including data handling, feature scaling, balancing classes, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the model for this real-world business use case.
